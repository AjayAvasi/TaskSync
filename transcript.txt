[Video Call Transcript – Startup Weekly Standup]
Timmy (Manager):
Alright team, thanks for hopping on. Let’s do a quick check-in. As you know, our pizza analytics startup is moving fast — we need to get the MVP ready to demo next month. I’ll assign tasks today so we can stay on track.
Alex (Developer 1):
Sounds good, Timmy.
Sarah (Developer 2):
Yep, ready.
Timmy:
Okay, first up — Alex. I need you to focus on our data ingestion pipeline. We’ve been pulling in reviews from Yelp and Google Maps, but it’s messy. I want you to:
Set up a scheduled ETL job that runs daily.
Normalize the review data into our Postgres schema.
Add logging so we can track failed ingestions.
How does that sound?
Alex:
Makes sense. I’ll use Airflow for scheduling, and write transformations in Python. For logging, should I push events into our existing monitoring dashboard?
Timmy:
Exactly. Send logs to Grafana via Prometheus metrics.
Timmy:
Now, Sarah — your focus is on the frontend dashboard. We need restaurant owners to visualize insights easily. Your tasks are:
Build a React component that shows average ratings by day of week.
Implement a map view where restaurants are plotted with color-coded performance indicators.
Connect the dashboard to our Flask backend API.
Sarah:
Got it. For the map view, should I use Leaflet or Google Maps API?
Timmy:
Let’s go with Leaflet — it’s lighter, and we can self-host tiles if needed.
Timmy:
Finally, big picture: I’ll handle getting us some sample client data from local pizza chains. I’ll also work on refining our business metrics so we know what features to prioritize.
Before we wrap up — Alex, what’s your ETA on the ingestion pipeline?
Alex:
I can get the initial ETL up by Wednesday, then polish logging by Friday.
Timmy:
Perfect. Sarah, how about the frontend tasks?
Sarah:
I’ll have the rating visualization ready in three days. The map view might take until next week, depending on API integration.
Timmy:
That’s fine. Let’s regroup next Monday, same time. Thanks team, this was productive.
Alex:
Thanks. Catch you all later.
Sarah:
Bye!
